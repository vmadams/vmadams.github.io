	<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. <br> 
	Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
	roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
	<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and <br>
	gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity <br>
	and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom <br>
	facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
	<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for <br>
	changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's helpful to <br>
	bring a flashligh and sense of adventure!</dd>
